# Image Processing Transforms
This code performs different image processing transforms on a grayscale image. The transforms implemented are:

Logarithmic transform
Power-law (gamma) transform
Square root transform
Anti-logarithmic transform
# Usage
Provide the image to be transformed by specifying the filename in the first line of the code: im=imread('Screenshot_2.jpg');
Run the code in a MATLAB environment.
The resulting transformed images will be displayed in a 2x3 subplot figure.
