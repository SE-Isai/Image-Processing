# Image Contrast Enhancement
This MATLAB code reads an image, converts it to grayscale, and applies contrast enhancement to it. The code calculates the histogram of the original image and displays it along with the original image. It then applies a contrast enhancement formula to obtain a new image and calculates the histogram of the new image.

# Usage
Place the image file to be processed in the same folder as the MATLAB code and rename it to "imagen5.jpg".
Run the MATLAB code.
# Requirements
MATLAB
# Output
The code displays four images in a figure window. The first image is the original image, the second is its histogram, the third is the contrast enhanced image, and the fourth is its histogram.
